# Major and Minor MT decomposition
Major and Minor DC MT decomposition preserving the dominant PT-axis
***************************************

  Open-source Matlab functions for decomposition of non-DC MTs with
preserved dominant P- or T-axis. The dominant axis direction is preserved
for both the major and minor DC MTs. The Python script can be used for
plotting of the trinity of beach-balls.

  Hallo, M., Asano, K., Gallovič, F. (2017). Bayesian inference and
interpretation of centroid moment tensors of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake
sequence, Kyushu, Japan, Earth, Planets and Space, 69:134.

2 PACKAGE CONTENT
===================

  a) "MajMinDC.m" - Matlab codes for computing Major and Minor DC
  decomposition from a given non-DC MT
  
  b) "MajMinDC_plot.py" - Python subroutine for plotting and saving
  trinity of beach-balls

3 REQUIREMENTS
===================

  MATLAB: Codes do not require any additional Matlab Toolboxes.
  
  PYTHON: The code was tested and works on both Python 2.7.6 and
  Python 3.4.3 under Ubuntu 14 operation system (it requires a graphical
  desktop environment).
